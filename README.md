# Azure-SIEM-Project-Threat-Detection-with-Sentinel-AMA
This repository contains my Azure SIEM Project, where I configured a cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) using Microsoft Sentinel, Log Analytics, and the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA). The environment includes multiple virtual machines connected via a virtual network, simulating attacker and victim scenarios. Logs were analyzed using Kusto Query Language (KQL), visualized through Sentinel workbooks, and enriched with geolocation data to track real-time attack sources.
